                            The 8-week course also teaches the pre-and post-production aspects of filmmaking, including video editing basics, editing styles, composition rules, color theory, 
                            audio editing, and mixing. You’ll be trained using industry-standard editing tools. To reinforce lessons outside of class, instructors will provide video 
                            links and supplemental pdfs. The class meets twice per week, running concurrently with the acting academy for students who are enrolled in both programs.
